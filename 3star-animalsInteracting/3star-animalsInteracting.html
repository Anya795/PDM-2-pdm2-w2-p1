    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This exercise builds on the 1 and 2 star exercises, so you will need to complete those before beginning this one.</p>
            <p>Once again, your task is to extend the <code>Animal</code> class you wrote in the previous exercise with new functionality 
            described below. Start by copying the code and assets from the last exercise.</p>
            <p>Modify the <code>Animal</code> class so that each animal can have its own sound. You should also have a public method that can be called to play the sound.</p>
            <p>Add input controls to the sketch that will enable the user to select a single animal to be "active". Modify your <code>keyPressed()</code> implementation so 
            that only the active animal moves. Add new functionality so that when the user clicks on the canvas, the active animal moves to the mouse location.</p>
            <p>Finally, when one animal gets too close (you decide what that means!) to another, play the other animal's sound. For example, if animal A gets too close to animal B, 
                animal B's sound should play. Think carefully about how to design this functionality. You may need to add new methods to your <code>Animal</code> class. Some recommendations 
                are provided in the hint.

                    <p>If you need a reminder on working with audio, see <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound" target="_blank">the Sound documentation</a>, especially the section on <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.SoundFile" target="_blank">working with sound files</a>. The library is already linked.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM" target="_blank">DOM section of the p5.js reference</a> provides guidance on working with input controls. Buttons, a radio group, or a select are the recommended controls, of which buttons are the 
                    easiest to work with. Styling radio groups can be quite finnicky!</p>
                    <p>When working out the distance between two animals, you may find the p5.js <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/dist" target="_blank">dist()</a> function helpful. In addition to deciding how close is too close, you will have to decide where and when to 
                    calculate the distance between animals. In terms of where, you can either add a method to the <code>Animal</code> class or make a new function in the main sketch. In terms of when to check 
                the distance between animals, aim for efficiency. You should not need to check unless an animal has moved (i.e., don't check every time <code>draw()</code> runs).</p>
                    <p>If your <code>Animal</code> attributes are private, you will almost certainly need to add getter functions (e.g. <code>getX()</code> and <code>getY()</code>) to complete this exercise.</p>
