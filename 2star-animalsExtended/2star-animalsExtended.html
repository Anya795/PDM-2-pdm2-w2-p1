    <h1>2 Star - Animals Extended</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This exercise builds on the 1 star exercise, so you will need to complete that exercise before beginning this one.</p>
            <p>Your task is to extend the <code>Animal</code> class you wrote in the previous exercise with new functionality 
            described below. Start by copying the code and assets from the last exercise.</p>
            <h3>New Functionality</h3>
            <p>Some animals are dangerous, some are not. Your <code>Animal</code> class should have a way to 
            represent the dangerousness of an individual animal. You will definitely need a new attribute but you should decide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Should it be public or private? OOP best practice is to make all attributes private, unless there's a good reason why users of the class should be able to freely edit its value.</li>
                <li>What values should it have? The sample solution uses three integers to represent not dangerous, may be dangerous, definitely dangerous, but feel free to represent this attribute in another way.</li>
                <li>How should the dangerousness be set? Should it be set at creation via the constructor or via a method? Should it be possible to change?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lastly, modify the <code>display()</code> method to create a visual representation of danger. The video below uses a simple coloured border. Feel free to be more creative!</p>
            <p>There are no tests for this exercise as it is open ended.</p>
            <p>Optional extension: consider using exceptions to ensure that code using your class sets dangerousness appropriately.</p>
            
            <p>Example output (yours may be different, depending on your views on danger and how you want to represent it):</p>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>It is recommended that you make your new attribute private because there is no indication that users 
                        would want to use it themselves—it is only used when the animal is displayed.
                    </p>
